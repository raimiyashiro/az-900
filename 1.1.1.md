# 1.1.1. - What is cloud computing?
---

It's the **delivery of computing services over the internet**. Computing services can be offered as servers, databases, and software.

## Cloud computing advantages
With cloud computing, there are no Capital Expenses (CapEx). It means that the users don't have to acquire hardware, neither spend their resources with physical infrastructure to operate.


### Reliability
Cloud-based applications can provide a service with no apparent downtime.

### Scalability
Applications in the cloud can be scaled automatically. A cloud-based application scales either _vertically_ (adding RAM or CPUs to a single VM) or _horizontally_ (adding new instances of a resource, such as more VMs to a pool).

### Elasticity
It is possible to increase or decrease resources according to the business requirements. If many users are trying to access an Application in the cloud, administrators can add more power to the configuration. They can also set it to increase automatically and to eliminate resources as they are no longer needed.

### Agility
Applications running in the cloud can be quickly deployed. Also, it is easy to configure an App during runtime, with a minimum downtime until the changes are applied.

### Geo-distribution
Cloud-based apps can be running in datacenters around the globe, which brings a better experience to users from different regions.
